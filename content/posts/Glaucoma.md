## Definition
Glaucoma comprises a diverse group of disorders , it comprises optics neuropathy associated with visual field loss .IOP(intra ocular pressure) is the key modifiable factor.

## Classification
(A) congenital and develpemental Glaucoma
classified as 

(i) Primary congenital/developemental glaucoma(PCG) 

(ii)Secondary congenital / developemental Glaucoma
              
The secondary congenital /developemental glaucoma is further classified as 

(i)Developemental glaucoma with congential ocular ocuar anomalies 

(ii)Developemental Glaucoma associated with systemic anomalies
                                                                           

## PCG
The PCG occours due to the developementl anomaly of Anterior chamber and it is not associated with any other ocular and systemic anomaly ,the prinary congenital glaucoma or we call it as (PCG) is also further classified  depending up on the age .

(i) Newborn Glaucoma - called as true congenital glaucoma is labelled when IOP raises in Intra uterine life , 40% cases

(ii) Infantile Glaucoma - prior to child birth 55% cases

(iii)Juvenile Glaucoma -  5% cases arises after  years 

## Secondary Developemental Glaucoma

the secondary developemental glaucoma is classified as

(i)Developemental glaucoma with congential ocular  anomalies 

-Associated with iridodysgenesis

-Associated with Aniridia

-Associated with microcornea

-Associated with nanophthalmos

-Associated with Iridocorneal dysgenesis

- Posterior embryo taxon

- Peters anomaly

(ii) Secondary developemental Glaucoma associated with systemic anomaly

1) Associated with trisomy of 13-15,21 Downs syndrome , turner syndrome,edwards syndrome

2) Glaucoma associated withEctropia lentis 

3) Glaucoma associated metabolic syndrome (e.g Lowes syndrome)


## Pathogenesis

Maldevelopement from neural crest derived cells of trabaculum including irridotrabecular Junction causes impaired aquesous outflow resulting in raised Intraocular pressure.

Traveculodysgenesis  includes 

a) Flat iris insertion which is more common

b) concave iris insertion which is less common


## Clinical features

1) Lacrimation

2) Photophobia

3) blepharospasm

4) eye rubbing

5) riased iop

Corneal signs
oedema 
desment breaks
corneal enlargement
corneal oedema
Hazy cornea

sclera - thining appears blue , Anterior chamber becomes deep and  Lens becomes anterior posterior flat

optic disc show variable cupping and with raised IOP Axial myopia and large eyeball (bupthalmos ) these are the clinical presentation.
