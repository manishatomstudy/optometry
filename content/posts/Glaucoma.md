## Definition
Glaucoma comprises a diverse group of disorders , it comprises optics neuropathy associated with visual field loss .IOP(intra ocular pressure) is the key modifiable factor.

## Classification
(A) congenital and develpemental Glaucoma
classified as 

(i) Primary congenital/developemental glaucoma(PCG) 

(ii)Secondary congenital / developemental Glaucoma
              
The secondary congenital /developemental glaucoma is further classified as 

(i)Developemental glaucoma with congential ocular ocuar anomalies 

(ii)Developemental Glaucoma associated with systemic anomalies
                                                                           

## PCG
The PCG occours due to the developementl anomaly of Anterior chamber and it is not associated with any other ocular and systemic anomaly ,the prinary congenital glaucoma or we call it as (PCG) is also further classified  depending up on the age .

(i) Newborn Glaucoma - called as true congenital glaucoma is labelled when IOP raises in Intra uterine life , 40% cases

(ii) Infantile Glaucoma - prior to child birth 55% cases

(iii)Juvenile Glaucoma -  5% cases arises after  years 

## Secondary Developemental Glaucoma

the secondary developemental glaucoma is classified as

(i)Developemental glaucoma with congential ocular  anomalies 

-Associated with iridodysgenesis

-Associated with Aniridia

-Associated with microcornea

-Associated with nanophthalmos

-Associated with Iridocorneal dysgenesis

- Posterior embryo taxon

- Peters anomaly

(ii) Secondary developemental Glaucoma associated with systemic anomaly

1) Associated with trisomy of 13-15,21 Downs syndrome , turner syndrome,edwards syndrome

2) Glaucoma associated withEctropia lentis 

3) Glaucoma associated metabolic syndrome (e.g Lowes syndrome)


## Pathogenesis

Maldevelopement from neural crest derived cells of trabaculum including irridotrabecular Junction causes impaired aquesous outflow resulting in raised Intraocular pressure.

Traveculodysgenesis  includes 

a) Flat iris insertion which is more common

b) concave iris insertion which is less common


## Clinical features

1) Lacrimation

2) Photophobia

3) blepharospasm

4) eye rubbing

5) riased iop

Corneal signs
oedema 
desment breaks
corneal enlargement
corneal oedema
Hazy cornea

sclera - thining appears blue , Anterior chamber becomes deep and  Lens becomes anterior posterior flat

optic disc show variable cupping and with raised IOP Axial myopia and large eyeball (bupthalmos ) these are the clinical presentation.

## Diagnosis
Comprehensive eye exam: A comprehensive eye exam involves a visual acuity test to measure how well a patient can see at different distances, a dilated eye exam to examine the optic nerve and retina, and tonometry to measure intraocular pressure (IOP).

Visual field test: A visual field test measures the patient's peripheral vision to detect any areas of vision loss, which can be an early sign of glaucoma.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT): OCT is a non-invasive imaging test that uses light waves to produce detailed images of the optic nerve and retina. This test can help detect any changes or damage to these structures that may be indicative of glaucoma.

Gonioscopy: Gonioscopy is a specialized exam that involves the use of a special lens to view the drainage angle of the eye and assess its function.

Pachymetry: Pachymetry measures the thickness of the cornea, which can affect the accuracy of IOP measurements and can be a risk factor for glaucoma.

Genetic testing: In some cases, genetic testing may be recommended to identify any underlying genetic mutations or predisposition to developing glaucoma.
## Management
Medications: Eye drops or oral medications may be prescribed to help reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), which is the main risk factor for glaucoma. These medications may include beta-blockers, prostaglandin analogs, alpha-adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, or a combination of these.

Laser therapy: In some cases, laser therapy may be used to help reduce IOP by improving drainage of fluid from the eye. The most common types of laser therapy for glaucoma include selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT), laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI), and cyclophotocoagulation.

Surgery: If medications and laser therapy are not effective in controlling IOP, surgery may be recommended to improve fluid drainage from the eye. Some common types of glaucoma surgery include trabeculectomy, implantation of a glaucoma drainage device, or minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS).

Regular eye exams: It is important for patients with glaucoma to have regular eye exams to monitor their condition and adjust their treatment plan as needed. Early detection and treatment can help prevent or slow the progression of vision loss.

Lifestyle modifications: Certain lifestyle modifications may also be recommended to help manage glaucoma, such as avoiding activities that increase IOP (e.g., heavy lifting or straining), eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking.
